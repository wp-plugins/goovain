Uses Google's URL shortener (Goo.gl) to create short links and convert to Vanity Urls.

NOTE: When updating this plugin the url and API will have to be reset because the placeholders in the files will revert back to the originals.

== Description ==

This plugin creates goo.gl short URLs for your posts, which are changed to the desired vanity url. Then you can retrieve them using the "Get Shortlink" button in your admin UI of the post or the `wp_get_shortlink()` WordPress function. This also changes the link rel='shortlinkâ€™ in the document head and adds a column in the post list showing the short url as well.

REQUIRED: Need to have a Short Url domain (your.com) pointed at goo.gl and you need to have a google API Key (https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/aaa_apikeys).

== Installation ==

1. Upload archive contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add you short url and API Key in Settings-> GooVain Settings 
1. You're done!

== Screenshots ==

1. post edit page
2. post list page
3. Document head link
4. wordpress settings page
