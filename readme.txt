Uses Google's URL shortener (Goo.gl) to create short links and convert to Vanity Urls never adding anything to the database.

== Description ==

This plugin creates goo.gl short URLs for your posts, which then could be changed to the desired vanity url and retrieved using the "Get Shortlink" button in your admin UI or the `wp_get_shortlink()` WordPress function. This also changes the link rel='shortlinkâ€™ in the document head and adds a column in the post list showing the short url as well.

This plugin does all this without storing any values in the database. Instead it writes the shorturl to a text file and retrieves from said text file.

Note: Need to have a Short Url domain (your.com). The short url domain does not have to be pointed at the site or stored on the site, it just needs to be a valid domain.


== Installation ==

1. Upload archive contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add you short url in Settings-> GooVain Settings 
1. You're done!

== Screenshots ==

1. post edit page
2. post list page
3. Document head link
4. wordpress settings page

== Change log ==
= 1.1 =
* added options page to change short url without editing code.
* added text file to store data instead of storing in the database.

= 1.0 =
* Hurray
